# Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a simple two-player Tic Tac Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game features a responsive and visually attractive design, with a glowing effect that adds a touch of fun and excitement.

## DOM Manipulation 
In this Tic Tac Toe game code, the Document Object Model (DOM) is used to manipulate HTML elements on the web page. The main features of the DOM that are used include accessing DOM elements using querySelector and querySelectorAll, modifying DOM element properties such as textContent and classList, adding and removing event listeners using addEventListener and removeEventListener, and updating CSS properties using the style property. These features allow the game to update the state of the game board, display the current player's turn, and respond to user actions such as clicking on a cell or restarting the game.
